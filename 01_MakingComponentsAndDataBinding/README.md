## There are 3 ways of passing html form values to the ts
1. Using 2 way data binding
2. using local variable and passing it to the function from html to ts
3. Using local variable and @ViewChild to get those variable to ts from html.

## ng-content
It is used to have HTML element passed down to the child. 
By default everything inside the child tag used in parent will be lost
But if you use ng-content it will stay.
